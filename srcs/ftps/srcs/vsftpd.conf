# FTP uses two connections: The command/login connection, using TCP port 21 by default, and a second TCP port for the data connection. The second one is normally assigned randomly, but here we will fix it to use port 30021, which corresponds to the port that the Dockerfile exposed on the container and that the pod and service use.
